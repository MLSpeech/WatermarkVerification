\section{Finding the minimal change that will get rid of the network's WaterMark}
Given a watermarked trained neural network as described \href{https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-adi.pdf}{here}. We tested what is the minimal change to the network last layer in order to "remove" some watermarks from the network. 
\subsection{Defining the problem}
Given a neural network $N$ with an output size $m$ the network decision for an input $x$ is defined as the coordinate with the maximal value, if the network output is the vector $y$ the decision is $argmax_{i\in \bracketsS{m}} \bracketsC{y_i}$
\\\\
Given a watermarked network $N$ with a set of $K$ watermarks (A set of inputs to the network) $\bracketsC{x_1,\cdots,x_K}$ we'll mark the network last layer $L$ such that $L$ is a $m\times n$ matrix were $n$ is the layer's number of neurons and $m$ is the network output size.
The change to the last layer will be a matrix with the same dimension as $L$ we'll mark as $\varepsilon$, such that $\varepsilon_{i,j}$ is the change to the last layer matrix entry $L_{i,j}$. Well measure the overall change to the layer as $\norm{\varepsilon}_{\infty} = max_{i,j}\bracketsC{\abs{\varepsilon_{i,j}}}$.
\\\\
For a certain input $x$ we're only interested in the input to the last layer we'll mark the input to the last layer $v$. $v$ is a $n\times 1$ vector.
So the original network output $y = Lv$ and the changed network output is $y' = (L+\varepsilon)v$. For a single input $x$ we need to find the minimal $\varepsilon$ so that the $argmax_{i\in\bracketsS{m}}\bracketsC{y_i}\neq argmax_{i\in\bracketsS{m}}\bracketsC{y'_i}$
\\\\ 
Denote $d := argmax_{i\in \bracketsS{m}} \bracketsC{y_i}$ \\
For some $d'\in\bracketsS{m},d'\neq d$ finding $\varepsilon$ with minimal $\norm{\varepsilon}_{\infty}$ such that $y' = (L+\varepsilon)v\,$ and $\,d' = argmax_{i\in\bracketsS{m}}\bracketsC{y'_i}$ can be described in a Linear Programming form like so:

\begin{align*}
    Minimize:\quad & c \\
    Subject\ to:\quad & -c \leq\varepsilon_{i,j}\leq c\ \forall i,j\\
    & y'=(L+\varepsilon)v \\
    & y'_d \leq y'_{d'}\\
\end{align*}
